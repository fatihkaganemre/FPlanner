# FPlanner
It is a sample app for trying SwiftUI and SwiftData
It allows you to:
- Create training
- Display list of trainings
- Edit/Remove trainings and exercises

# Tech stack
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData

# What is next: 
- Remove or Reduce the duplication
- Move out the logic from UI
- I should add some kind of routing for going back after saving or creating a training
- Handle TODO comments
- Think of adding Tests if needed
- Update the UI , it looks very ugly :/
- For every update of exercise try to create a performance graph !!
