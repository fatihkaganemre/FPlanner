# FPlanner
It is a sample app for trying SwiftUI and SwiftData
It allows you to:
- Create training
- Display list of trainings
- Edit/Remove trainings and exercises

# Tech stack
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData

# What is next: 
- Routing 
- Add Tests //  Try out swift testing framework
- Update the UI , it looks very ugly :/
- For every update of exercise try to create a performance graph !!
- Notifying user for the training 
- Tracking the exercises and ringing an alarm once the exercise completes
    - Live activity widget configuration
    - .supplementalActivityFamilies([.small]) for watchOS
- Add sharing training via app or via notes app ! // Swipe action 
- Try to add Siri feature the the app (App Intents API)
- Is there any way to ask ChatGPT in the app for better training ? 
- Maybe use Image playground sheet to let users to add some image to training
